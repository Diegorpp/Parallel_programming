# Parallel Programming

This collage work is about managing threads to avoid race condition, dead-lock and do effectively execute proccess in parallel. This project it's a variation of the famous problem called "Dining philosophers problem". This variation use the pandemic context to build vaccines. In short terms, in this problem you have two threads working as consumer and one as producer, and a place where they need to interact to consume and replace resources to get their vaccine.

To run the project you can just use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -o trab.exe trab -lpthread
```
